## Goals
- Our goal is to create a note-taking application to enhance study process for university students.
- The enhancements will encompass note-taking and knowledge accumulation, in an easy and intuitive manner.
- The application should allow users to take notes, set schedules and create notifications.

## Target Audience
The main users of the application are the Open University students, as well as anyone with needs connected to distance learning and study management. The design of the application aims to allow comfortable use for teenage and adult population.

## Background and strategic fit
Distance learning is experiencing a significant uptake. With increasing number of distance learners and self-education enthusiasts, there is a growing demand for applications connected to distance learning, namely calendars, time monitors and note registers. The OpenStudy application draws from experience of the Open University students and allows for a concerted and united application of such features.
